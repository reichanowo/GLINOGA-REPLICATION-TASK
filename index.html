    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The 2025 midterm elections are approaching, and maintaining a <strong>peaceful and fair environment is critical.</strong> Every effort must be made to promote <em>ethical practices</em> during this time. The filing period for certificates of candidacy ended on the 30th of October 2023, marking the beginning of this crucial period leading up to the elections.</p>
    
    <h3>Promoting Fair Campaigning</h3>
    <p>The <em>Commission on Elections</em> (Comelec), despite challenges, can work with civic organizations and government agencies to remove campaign materials placed in public spaces, <strong>such as trees, lampposts, and school walls.</strong> This action can be taken even before the official campaign period to prevent violations of environmental laws.</p>
    
    <h3>Preventing Election Violence</h3>
  <p>The <abbr title="Philippine National Police">PNP</abbr> has committed to ensuring safety during the elections. With <strong>over 18,280 elective positions</strong> at stake, the task is substantial. However, political violence, including intimidation and harassment, must be stopped. Politicians <strong>must reject violence and instead focus on ethical campaigning</strong></p>
  
  <blockquote>"Every candidate must now be encouraged or compelled to play by the rules instead of going around them, and to eschew the use of armed violence."1 â€” <br>
  Editorial Excerpt, 2023</blockquote>
  
  <p>As we prepare for the elections, candidates must be held accountable for their actions. Let's encourage everyone to play by the rules and promote a peaceful election process.</p>
